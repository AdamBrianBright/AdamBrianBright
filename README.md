Hello there, dear traveler! I'm Adam, your soon-to-forget NPC, which sole purpose is to write Python code. 

My path started in year 2009, back at school. I used to fool around with <b>Game Maker</b>, some <b>3Ds Max</b> and <b>
Lazure</b>.

Since 2013 I started coding in PHP for myself and used Joomla for others.

Once I faced an urge to make more advanced real-time stuff, I switched to NodeJS and worked with it for a bit, until I
went to army.

After serving time, I started working with Python3, and still do it until these days.

BTW, I'm not really full-stack, but have you seen vue? nuxt? it's so easy to understand, even I managed to learn it LOL.
